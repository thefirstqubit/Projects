Cash Disbursements Control Risks
1. Lack of supplier due diligence.
2. Purchases and payments are not validated and authorized.
3. Cash is not reconciled to bank statements.
4. Payment issuance and approval and recording of payment responsibilities are not
segregated.

Business Process (BP), IT & Automated Control Gaps & Risks
1. Automated Control Gap: Purchase requisitions are automatically approved via an
automated control configuration in the system. (Risk 1 and 2)
2. BP Gap: Lack of a three-way match control (PO, Goods Receipt, and Invoice). (Risk 2)
3. BP and IT Gap: Lack of segregation of duties during invoice verification since invoices
are sent to the warehouse/inventory team, not Finance/Accounting. (Risk 4)
4. BP Gap: Cash disbursement (vendor payment) process is not controlled as anyone in
purchasing can write checks. (Risk 4)
5. IT Gap: Insufficient access controls over the purchasing system, including the lack of a
formal user access request and verification process. (Risk 4)
6. Potential BP GAP: No evidence of cash reconciliation process. (Risk 3)
